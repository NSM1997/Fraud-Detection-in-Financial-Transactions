# Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions

In this We work on an Financial Dataset and finds whether a transaction is Fraud or Not.

The Dataset is available in Kaggle, You can access from here.

# About Dataset

  The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we      have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
  
  It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original     
  features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA,
  
  -The only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'.
  
  -Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
  
  -The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it 
   takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

  # Methodology

  We have Performed like Data cleaning , Data visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis , Train the model, Model Testing and Model Evaluation.
  Choosen Model : Decision Trees.

  # Conclusion

  Evaluated the performance of the choosen model and drawn Inferences.

  # Final Inference:

  We decided whether this model is better for this type of datasets and recommended other models which can work better for this.
